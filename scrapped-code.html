        My journey began in Lewisburg Mississippi where I went to high school. It all started with my first computer science class, where I was introduced to the world of Python programming. This initial spark ignited a passion that led me to explore further. I soon found myself at DeSoto Technical Center, enrolling in a networking class that not only expanded my networking skills but also introduced me to the realms of HTML and CSS.
        During my time at DeSoto Technical Center, a career-focused institution, I didn't limit my learning to the classroom. I took on personal projects, deploying small websites and creating scripts, as I was determined to broaden my skill set. Simultaneously, my career at Malco Theaters was on the rise. I was promoted to manager, and this pivotal moment fueled my ambition. My goal was clear â€“ to become a well-rounded IT professional capable of fixing and creating solutions from the ground up. My dedication and hard work were recognized when I received the 'Reaching for the Stars' award from the Lieutenant Governor, alongside various certifications from the DeSoto Technical Center program.
        My journey then took me to Water Valley, where I joined Base Camp Coding Academy. This immersive experience expanded my knowledge of software development and further enriched my skill set. Today, I stand as a testament to the power of continuous learning and determination, ready to take on new challenges and contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology.
